# wget config file

# TeXLive uses wget. Make wget as robust as possible here.
# Make downloading as robust as possible since TeXLive/TUG servers can be unreliable.
# If we leave downloading to the install script, we cannot influence the parameters
# and it might fail without retrying and for unfortunate reasons at that (like
# failing the entire install an hour in because of one package that failed to
# download). All of this is exacerbated using Docker, since we are building remotely
# on their infrastructure, which is inaccessible. A failure after 8h of queue and
# 2h of build time due to unstable downloads is annoying.
